      "plainText": "Hello! What is the type of knowledge that is injected in the neural networks?\n\nHi! We inject domain knowledge from Constrained Satisfaction Problems.\n Facts: \n1. Using a classical constrained problem as a case study grants access to reliable domain knowledge (the declarative formulation), and facilitates the generation of empirical data (problem solutions).\n\n\nInteresting! What is the problem used to perform the experiment?\n\nWe employ the Partial Latin Square completion problem. Do you want to know how does it work?\n Facts: \n1. We use as a benchmark the Partial Latin Square (PLS) completion problem,\n\n\nYes, thank you\n\nYou have a partially filled NxN square and you have to complete it with all the values in the range from 1 to N preventing the same value to appear more than once in the same row or column.\n Facts: \n1. We use as a benchmark the Partial Latin Square (PLS) completion problem, which requires to complete a partially filled n × n square with values in {1..n}, such that no value appears twice on any row or column.\n\n\nI understand. And how is knowledge injected in these networks?\n\nI'm sorry but I have not enough information to answer your question. Do you want to know why we choose the to inject knowledge in a data-driven approach?\n\nyes, thank you!\n\nData-driven methods can take into account preferences that are hard to design in Constrained Satisfaction Problem. At the same time data-driven method struggle to preserve feasibility.\n Facts: \n1. Constrained problem are classically modeled by domain experts in a fully declarative fashion: however, such models can be hard to design, may rely on simplistic and unquantifiable approximations, and may fail to take into account constraints (or preferences)\n2. Data-driven methods for constrained problems offer a potential solution for some of these issues, but they may have trouble maintaining feasibility\n\n\n"

      "plainText": "Hi! What is the article about?\n\nThe article is about a new neural architecture to perform Argument Mining. This architecture features an attention module and is validated on multiple corpora. Which aspect would you like to know more about?\n Facts: \n1. A novel approach to AM, which extends our previous work [7] by introducing an attention module and ensemble learning. Such a model performs multiple AM tasks at the same time, and does not rely on ad-hoc features or rich contextual information\n2. A set of experiments designed to assess generality, whereby we test our approach on three additional corpora that vary in domain, style of writing, formatting, length, and annotation model\n\n\nCan you tell me how does the attention module work?\n\nI'm sorry, but I don't have information on this aspect. Would you like to know more about the argument mining task instead?\n Facts: \n1. The model exploits neural attention and multi-task learning, jointly addressing the problems of identifying the category of argument components, and predicting the relations among them.\n\n\nYes, tell me more about it.\n\nArgument Mining is a research field related to NLP that concerns the extraction and the classification of arguments and their relationships.\n Facts: \n1. A RGUMENT mining (AM) is an emerging research area in natural language processing (NLP) which aims to extract arguments from text collections [1] . AM consists of several different tasks, that include argument detection, stance classification, topic-based argumentative content retrieval, and many ot\n2. Such problem comprises the detection of both argument components, and relations (or links) amongst them, and is thus one of the most difficult steps for AM systems.\n\n\nWhat kind of corpora was the neural architecture tested on?\n\nIt was tested on corpora composed by user-generated comments and by scientific publications\n Facts: \n1. We evaluate it on a challenging data set consisting of usergenerated comments, as well as on two other datasets consisting of scientific publications.\n\n\nOn which of the two did the architecture perform best?\n\nThe best performance was achieved on the first one\n Facts: \n1. On the user-generated content dataset, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods that rely on domain knowledge. On the scientific literature datasets it achieves results comparable to those yielded by BERT-based approaches but with a much smaller model size.\n\n\nDo you know why this happened?\n\nThere is no information available about this. Do you want to know more or are you satisfied?\n\n"

Using a classical constrained problem as a case study, we perform controlled experiments to probe the impact of progressively adding domain and empirical knowledge in the DNN.\n\n\nThis sounds very interesting. How exactly do you inject knowledge in the network?\n\nUnfourtunately I have not enough information to answer your question.\n\nOk, thanks anyhow. Which kind of problems has the method you propose been applied to?\n\nWe applied to a particular class of Constrained Satisfaction problem. Do you want to know which one?\n Facts: \n1. One such case is that of Constraint Problems, for which declarative approaches exists and pure ML solutions have obtained mixed success.\n2.  As a byproduct of our analysis, we develop general techniques for taking into account constraints in data-driven methods for decision problems, based on easily accessible methods from the Constraint Programming and Machine Learning domains.\n\n\nYes, please. Which kind of CSP problems?\n\nWe employ the Partial Latin Square completion problem which require to complete a partially filled NxN square with all the values in the range from 1 to N such that no value appear twice in any row and column.\n Facts: \n1. We use as a benchmark the Partial Latin Square (PLS) completion problem, which requires to complete a partially filled n × n square with values in {1..n}, such that no value appears twice on any row or column.\n\n\nThank you. I believe that plugging knowledge into neural architectures is a crucial issue for AI in the coming years. Do you need to encode the knowledge in some language?

As a byproduct of our analysis, we develop general techniques for taking into account constraints in data-driven methods for decision problems, based on easily accessible methods from the Constraint Programming and Machine Learning domains.\n2.

How did they select those images?\n\nThe images were taken randomly from Instagram, but cannot be shared as pictures.\n Facts: \n1. The images, instead, are released as a ResNet-18 neural network trained on ImageNet, similar to recent NLP works (Kruk et al., 2019) , since they were taken from Instagram and cannot be shared as pictures.\n\n\nHow did they annotate those images? using human annotators or in some unsupervised fashion?\n\nThe comments were made by teenagers during their school hours, then they were manually assigned to a semantic category.\n Facts: \n1. In this paper, we present a novel dataset composed of images and comments in Italian, created with teenagers in classes using a simulated scenario to raise awareness on cyberbullying phenomena.\n2.

The dataset is freely available on Github 2 and, since the comments were collected with the written consent of parents and teachers, they can be freely used for research purposes, without the ethical implications that would derive from using real data posted by teenage users.\n\n\nWhy is dataset multimodal?\n\nThe dataset was analysed from different perspectives. For example the analysys could consider the presence of human subjects or the gender of the people.\n Facts: \n1. We therefore present a novel corpus containing images and potentially offensive Italian comments and we analyse it from different perspectives, to investi-gate whether the subject of the images plays a role in triggering a comment.\n2. Our analysis shows that the presence of human subjects, as well as the gender of the people present in the pictures trigger different types of comment, and provides novel insight into the connection between images posted on social media and offensive messages.\n\n\nThank you, is there any other aspect worth of mention?\n\nThe corpus was also compared with a similar one obtained using whatsapp. This comparison showed that comments to images have different characteristics.\n Facts: \n1. We also compare our corpus with a similar one obtained with What-sApp, showing that comments to images show different characteristics compared to text-only interactions.\n\n\n"

We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be truste\n\n\nWhat should we talk about now?\n\nI can tell you more about specific use cases of this tool. For example, it could be very beneficial when it comes to trusting machine learning for mediacal diagnosis.\n Facts: \n1. When using machine learning for medical diagnosis [6] or terrorism detection, for example, predictions cannot be acted upon on blind faith, as the consequences may be catastrophic.\n\n\nDo they say something about comparison with other methods?\n\nUnfortunately not, they propose two different methods of their own.\n Facts: \n1. • LIME, an algorithm that can explain the predictions of any classifier or regressor in a faithful way, by approximating it locally with an interpretable model. • SP-LIME, a method that selects a set of representative instances with explanations to address the \"trusting the model\" problem, via submo\n\n\nWhich one is the best among the two methods?\n\nThey are different, but I think LIME is the most complete one as it was used by non experts to pick the best out of two classifiers and improve an untrustworthy one.\n Facts: \n1.

Detecting and explaining unfairness in consumer contracts through memory networks\n\n\nYes, please. What are memory networks?\n\nMemory networks or MANNs are neural architectures that include a \"memory\" components where knowledge can be stored and used to generate the output\n Facts: \n1. The basic idea behind MANNs is to combine the successful learning strategies developed in the machine learning literature for inference with a memory component that can be read and written to.\n2. A MANN can answer these questions by storing in dedicated parts of the network, called memories, all previously seen sentences, so as to retrieve the most relevant facts to a given query.\n\n\nHow are MANNs employed to detect and explain unfairness?\n\nThe memories could be used to store justifications of unfairness given by legal experts. Then these justifications can be used to explain the output\n Facts: \n1. our hypothesis is that useful explanations may be given in terms of rationales, i.e.  ad-hoc justifications provided by legal experts motivating their conclusion to consider a given clause as unfair.\n2. if we train a MANN classifier to identify unfair clauses by using as facts the rationales behind unfairness labels, then a possible explanation of an unfairness prediction could be constructed based on the list of memories, i.e., the rationales, used by the MANN\n\n\nIt seems very nice idea! Maybe it can be applied to other kind of tasks. What do you think?\n\nYes indeed. For example, memory networks have been used for question-answering.\n Facts: \n1. Consider for instance the following story:   Joe went to the kitchen.  Fred went to the kitchen. Joe picked up the milk. Joe travelled to the office. Joe left the milk.\n2. Joe went to the bathroom. Where is the milk now? Answering the question requires comprehension of the actions \"picked up\" and \"left\" as well as of the time elements of the story (Weston et al. 2014) .  A MANN can answer these questions\n\n\nCan you give me more details about the experimental setup?\n\nThe authors created a dataset of annotated Terms of Service and compared the performance of MANNs against relevant baselines. Do you want to know about qualitative evaluation too?\n Facts: \n1. The knowledge base of rationales constituted the basis for creating a corpus of 100 annotated ToS, which we used to train different MANN architecture configurations.\n2. We evaluated their performance with respect to relevant baselines, including support vector machine classifiers, convolutional neural networks and long shortmemory networks.\n\n\nYes, please.\n\nThe explanations were also evaluated by domain experts. If you are interested, I can tell you about the outcome of the evaluation\n Facts: \n1. We also run an initial qualitative evaluation with domain experts in order to understand the explanatory efficacy of rationales in this context.\n\n\nYes, I am really interested in it.\n\nResults are encouraging, and some baselines were outperformed by a significant margin. One interesting thing in this paper is the application of strong supervision. Do you want to know about it?\n Facts: \n1. The results on the new corpus are encouraging. The MANN architectures were able to match or outperform the baselines on all categories of unfair clauses, in some cases by a significant margin.\n2. unlike all other baselines, the MANN could provide meaningful references to the relevant rationales\n\n\nI think it's enough.

Anything else you wish to know?\n Facts: \n1. our hypothesis is that useful explanations may be given in terms of rationales, i.e.  ad-hoc justifications provided by legal experts motivating their conclusion to consider a given clause as unfair\n\n\nWhy are rationales useful?\n\nThe hypothesis is that rationales are useful for explainability. Indeed, initial results are promising. What do you think about the importance of explainability?\n Facts: \n1. in recent years a rich debate has flourished around the opacity of AI systems that, in terms of accuracy, offer unprecedented results, but at the same time cannot be easily inspected in order to find reasons behind blatant and even possibly dangerous mistakes.\n2. These results suggest that MANN are a promising way to address the problem of explaining unfairness in consumer contracts and pave the way to their extensive use in other areas of automated legal text analytics.\n\n\nI think explainability is very useful in AI. Anything else you would like to tell me about the article?\n\nYes. Something I like about this study is that the method is able to provide references to relevant rationales.\n Facts: \n1. the MANN could provide meaningful references to the relevant rationales, especially if during training the MANN is fed with the information of which rationales are related to which clause, a technique known as strong supervision\n\n\nThat's interesting! Can you tell me something more about this?\n\nI don't have further information about strong supervision, but the method seems promising\n Facts: \n1. These results suggest that MANN are a promising way to address the problem of explaining unfairness in consumer contracts and pave the way to their extensive use in other areas of automated legal text analytics.\n\n\nOk, thank you! That's all I wanted to know\n\nThat's great. Take care\n\nBye\n\nBye\n\n"

Because you can avoid re-constructing a corpus from scratch, but you can leverage the information coming from the same corpus in another language\n Facts: \n1. the workforce of professionals needed for annotating legal documents may not be readily available in each language\n2. Our ultimate goal is to use automatically generated annotations for training linguistic tools for the target language without resorting to expert annotators in that language\n\n\nIs this approach applicable only in legal texts?\n\nNo, it could be applied to any domain whether you have different versions of the same document.\n Facts: \n1. This would leverage the creation of classifiers that can leverage the linguistic resources available in the target language, to analyze documents in that language\n\n\nCan you tell me something more about how the method works?\n\nWe exploit automatic translation tools and a distance between embeddings to find correspondences between the same document, available in to languages.\n Facts: \n1. The solution we propose makes use of an automated translation of the source document into the target document, obtained via a third-party tool, of a sentence-wise dissimilarity metric, and of a method for finding an alignment between warped time series\n2. To carry out the present study, we built the first English-German parallel corpus for the task at hand\n\n\nIs the quality of the translation tool an issue?\n\nIt might be, but this needs further investigation. For sure, the method is language-agnostic.\n Facts: \n1. The main novelty of our study lies in the confluence of three aspects: the projection is performed at sentence-level; the multi-lingual corpus is asymmetric; and the proposed methods are language-agnostic\n\n\nWas the method tested with other language pairs besides English-German?\n\nNot in this paper, but we are currently testing two additional languages. Do you think this is an important problem?\n\nYes I think the problem is very important. Thank you for the chat.\n\nThank you!"

      "plainText": "What is a label suggestion?\n\nHi, label suggestions are created by a classification model and shown to annotators in an annotation scenario. The annotator can either accept the suggestion or correct it.\n Facts: \n1. label suggestions alleviate the annotation process by providing annotators with pre-annotations (i.e., predictions) from a model (Ringger et al., 2008; Schulz et al., 2019)\n\n\nDoes German Covid-19 social media mean something like Tweets associated with the pandemic?\n\nYes, exactly. In this work we gathered Twitter posts in German language which were posted during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nI see. Was it a predetermined number of labels or was it open?\n\nIt was predetermined and based on existing work in stance detection. There are 4 labels to express the author's stance about governmental measures taken to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nAh, so it's a stance detection (SD) paper. What do you think is the contribution this paper makes to the field that another SD doesn't? There have recently been several SD papers about tweets regarding the pandemic.\n\nThe main contribution of our work is not the stance detection task on social media but rather the investigation if label suggestions are helpful when annotating with novice annotators (e.g. crowdworkers or students). Existing work has mostly looked at label suggestions when using expert annotators. In our experiments, novice annotators do benefit from label suggestions, too.\n Facts: \n1. For tasks that do not require domain-specific knowledge and can be conducted with non-expert annotators -such as crowd workers or citizen science volunteers -on a large scale, label suggestions have not been considered yet. This leads to two open questions. First, if non-expert annotators that do no\n2. we show that although interactive and non-interactive label suggestions substantially improve the agreement\n\n\nDo you think your system biases your annotators towards or perhaps against the suggested label?\n\nThis is a great question and indeed a possible issue here. However, our analysis did not show such effects. We saw that annotators did not trust the model more over time and that they were able to reflect on systematic model errors.\n Facts: \n1. Nonetheless, our analysis of suggestion bias shows that annotators remain capable of reflecting upon the suggested label in general.\n\n\nThanks for the great reponse. Final question: why German? seems like English would be easier\n\nTwo answers: (1) German is less represented in NLP datasets and (2) this was an interdisciplinary collaboration with social scientists who are looking into public opinion dynamics in Germany during the pandemic. Thank you for your interest in our work!\n\n"

      "plainText": "Hi, what exactly is meant by lexical inference?\n\nHi, lexical inference means that the inference is focused on lexical semantics.\n Facts: \n1. Lexical inference in context (LIiC) is the task of recognizing textual entailment between two very similar sentences, i.e., sentences that only differ in one expression.\n2. It can therefore be seen as a variant of the natural language inference task that is focused on lexical semantics.\n\n\nOk, so the labels are the classical entailment labels (entailment, neutral, contradiction)?\n\nThat is a good question. Let me clarify: It is a binary classification task. So the labels are entailment vs. non-entailment.\n Facts: \n1. Lexical inference (LI) denotes the task of deciding whether or not an entailment relation holds between two lexical items.\n\n\nOk, so do they build a dataset for that?\n\nNo, they propose new models based on pretrained language models for the task. They evaluate them on two existing benchmarks.\n Facts: \n1. We formulate and evaluate the first approaches based on pretrained language models (LMs) for this task\n2. our experiments on two established LIiC benchmarks\n\n\nWhat makes their new models special?\n\nThe task inputs are fed to the language models in a context of textual patterns corresponding the two classes of the task. This outperforms approaches that do not use these patterns. What do you think about this pattern-based approach?\n Facts: \n1. We introduce the concept of antipatterns, patterns that express non-entailment, and evaluate their usefulness for LIiC.\n2. all our approaches consistently outperform previous work, thus setting a new state of the art for LIiC.\n\n\nBefore I can answer your question, I need to clarify something. The patterns are a form of \"prompts\"? Like additional tokens prepended or appended to the input?\n\nYes, this is like \"prompts\". The additional tokens can be before the two sentences, between them, after them, or a combination of the three.\n Facts: \n1. a relation induction approach based on handcrafted patterns expressing the semantics of lexical inference\n\n\nAh ok. It is interesting that such simple techniques help. This is not a few-shot setting right? So the model has full access to the training data?\n\nThere are no large-scale training set for the LIiC task.\n Facts: \n1. supervised NLI models need large amounts of training data, which is unavailable for LIiC\n\n\nI see.

This is a position paper which proposes to use neuro-symbolic and relational learning techniques to address the tasks in argumentation mining\n Facts: \n1. we posit that neural-symbolic and statistical relational learning could play a crucial role in the integration of symbolic and sub-symbolic methods to achieve this goal\n2. Deep learning is bringing remarkable contributions to the field of argumentation mining, but the existing approaches still need to fill the gap toward performing advanced reasoning tasks\n\n\ndo you have some sort of definition of argument mining to give me some background?\n\nSure! Argument mining is a research area in NLP which aims to extract arguments from unstructured text.\n Facts: \n1. The goal of argumentation mining (AM) is to automatically extract arguments and their relations from a given document\n2. Performing and understanding argumentation requires advanced reasoning capabilities, which are natural human skills, but are difficult to learn for a machine\n\n\nmany thanks for that. i was wondering how previously mentioned techniques could be employed in the context of argument mining.\n\nMany argument graphs follow some typical rules (i.e., a premise supports a claim, but not the other way round). These rules could be easily encoded in some symbolic language, and used in combination with neural networks or other classifiers.\n Facts: \n1. We envisage that a significant advancement in AM could come from the combination of symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches, such as those developed in the Neural Symbolic (NeSy) (Garcez et al., 2015) or Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) (Getoor and Taskar, 2007; De Raedt et al., 2016; Kordjamshidi\n2. We propose to exploit the potential of both symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches for AM, by combining both results in systems that are capable of modeling knowledge and constraints with a logic formalism, while maintaining the computational power of deep networks\n\n\ntherefore the idea is to encoded relations in a symbolic way and learn the importance of these relations along with the data-driven approach of deep learning, is that correct?\n\nYes, indeed. Do you think this might be an interesting research direction?\n Facts: \n1. Differently from existing approaches, we advocate the use of a logic-based language for the definition of contextual dependencies and constraints, independently of the structure of the underlying classifiers\n2. Most importantly, the approaches we outline do not exploit a pipeline scheme, but rather perform joint detection of argument components and relations through a single learning process\n\n\nthis is indeed quite interesting, i think i've seen many frameworks in this direction. I was wondering if suggested approach (at least current draft) scales well with samples and the number of relations. This is indeed one crucial point to me\n\nTrue: scalability is an issue in most neuro-symbolic applications. Unfortunately, we do not present experiments in this work, which is just a position paper.\n Facts: \n1. In this position paper, we posit that neural-symbolic and statistical relational learning could play a crucial role in the integration of symbolic and sub-symbolic methods to achieve this goal\n\n\ni see, do you have any more detail that you repute important? \n\nIt is worth mentioning that this goes into the direction widely recognized nowadays in AI of not relying just on deep learning for many tasks (even in NLP) but to introduce techniques that can exploit domain knowledge, and perform reasoning.\n Facts: \n1. Despite the remarkable impact of deep neural networks in NLP, we argue that these techniques alone will not suffice to address such complex issues\n2. This issue is also widely recognized as one of the major challenges for the whole field of artificial intelligence in the coming years (LeCun et al., 2015)\n\n\n"

Finally, we train models on our data to predict whether a tweet is parody or not.\n Facts: \n1.

We run a battery of supervised machine learning models for automatically detecting parody tweets\n2. Finally, we identify the markers of parody through a linguistic analysis.\n\n\nHow many annotators were involved in corpus creation?\n\nThe corpus was created by automatically retrieving tweets from parody accounts. Parody accounts were identified by the authors of this work. In total, 4 researchers took a look at the data.\n Facts: \n1. For this task, we create a new large-scale publicly available data set containing a total of 131,666 English tweets from 184 parody accounts and corresponding real accounts of politicians from the US, UK and other countries\n\n\nInteresting work. What features are more indicative of parody?\n\nIn our work we examine political parody. In political parody, exaggerated views and caricatures are the main features. Posts are also made to mimic real facts, but with a humorous twist.\n Facts: \n1. Parody tweets can often be misinterpreted as facts\n2. these accounts play with stereotypes of these figures or juxtapose their public image with a very different, behind-closed-doors persona. A very popular type of parody is political parody which plays an important role in public speech by offering irreverent interpretations of political personas\n\n\nThere may be some links to other NLP tasks, like irony detection. What do you think?\n\nI agree with this statement. Irony can be used to make a parody post, so detecting irony could facilitate better parody detection as well.\n Facts: \n1. While closely related figurative devices such as irony and sarcasm have been extensively studied in computational linguistics (Wallace, 2015; Joshi et al., 2017) , parody yet to be explored using computational methods.\n2.

Verifying facts can be very challenging and gains would be minimal. Furthermore, while parody can indeed be misinterpreted as facts, it mostly relies on the style of writing (ie. mimicking the real politician) and not so much the content.\n Facts: \n1.

      "plainText": "Hi, how is political parody defined the paper?\n\nParody is defined as a means to mimic behavior of a target for comedic purposes.\n Facts: \n1. Parody is a figurative device used to imitate an entity for comedic or critical purposes and represents a widespread phenomenon in social media through many popular parody accounts.\n2. Parody is a figurative device which is used to imitate and ridicule a particular target (Rose, 1993) and has been studied in linguistics as a figurative trope distinct to irony and satire (Kreuz and Roberts, 1993; Rossen-Knill and Henry, 1997) . Traditional forms of parody include editorial cartoons\n\n\nCan it be detected automatically in social media posts?\n\nIt can! In this work we show that we can reach an F1 score of up to 90% using neural-based deep learning methods.\n Facts: \n1. Our results show that political parody tweets can be predicted with an accuracy up to 90%\n2. Experiments with feature-and neural-based machine learning models for parody detection, which achieve high predictive accuracy of up to 89.7% F1.\n\n\nCan the model distinguish political parody from other forms of parody? The definition seemed to allow for non-political parody, too.\n\nHere we only collected political parody data, so the models only learn to identify data in that domain. We have not investigated whether the same model could detect general parody. I believe that while it is possible to detect non-political parody, more general data would be needed for that task.\n Facts: \n1. Beyond NLP, parody detection can be used in: (i) political communication, to study and understand the effects of political parody in the public speech on a large scale (Hariman, 2008; Highfield, 2016) ; (ii) linguistics, to identify characteristics of figurative language (Rose, 1993; Kreuz and Rober\n\n\nI see. So the model distinguishes political parody from other posts without any parody, yes? Is it possible that the model only detects the political topic without learning about parody at all?\n\nThe data is all in the political domain. Data comes from politician accounts as well as political parody accounts. So, the model operates entirely within the political domain, and learns to separate between parody and non-parody data.\n Facts: \n1. For this task, we create a new large-scale publicly available data set containing a total of 131,666 English tweets from 184 parody accounts and corresponding real accounts of politicians from the US, UK and other countries\n\n\nThat is very interesting. The resource sounds very useful. Are there annotations on the tweet-level or do you assume that a parody account only tweets parody and the others don't? Could the model be fooled into an author identification task?\n\nAnnotations are on the account level. That is, a parody account only tweets parody, while a real account only tweets normal speech. I do not believe this task will be reduced to author identification though. In our experiments, we also predict parody from previously unseen accounts (both parody and real) with the model performing well on those. This goes to show that the model is able to identify parody to an adequate level.)\n Facts: \n1. test data from: a) users; b) genders; c) locations; unseen in training\n2. Traditional forms of parody include editorial cartoons, sketches or articles pretending to have been authored by the parodied person. 2 A new form of parody recently emerged in social media, and Twitter in particular, through accounts that impersonate public figures.\n\n\nThat is very convincing. Thank you for the explanations. Could you tell me a bit about the analyzing part?\n\nWe performed a linguistic analysis, showing that a major difference between politician and parody accounts is the use of first-person pronouns in parody accounts. We also analyzed errors on the model's side, with humorous tweets from real politician's sometimes being confused for parody.\n Facts: \n1.

To alleviate these issues, this work proposes annotation curricula, a novel approach to implicitly train annotators.\n\n\nThat is interesting, how are the annotators then training during the annotation?\n\nThe basic idea comes from curriculum learning that aims to provide exercises to a (human) learner in an ordering that matches their learning proficiency. Our goal is to implement such a learning curriculum for annotation studies by assessing the difficulty of annotated instances.\n Facts: \n1. The learning curriculum is a fundamental concept in educational research that proposes to order exercises to match a learner's proficiency (Vygotsky 1978; Krashen 1982) and has even motivated training strategies for machine learning models (Bengio et al. 2009 ).\n2. Similarly, the goal of annotation curricula (AC) is to provide an ordering of instances during annotation that is optimized for learning the task.\n\n\nSo the difficulty of their annotations increment over time. Do you think this comes with an increase in total annotation time for the coder?\n\nSorry, I am not sure if I follow the question. By coder, do you mean the person setting up the study? If you mean the annotator; we restricted our experiments to a finite set of instances that is annotated. So the total annotation time for annotating these instances does actually decrease with a good curriculum.\n Facts: \n1. The results show that annotators who receive the same instances in an optimized order require significantly less annotation time while retaining a high annotation quality.\n\n\nOk, that's what I wanted to know. Another point I would be interested is how do you assess the difficulty of a sample? Like how do you determine the order of data you show the annotator?\n\nTo estimate the difficulty, we investigate several methods. Non-adaptive ones like heuristics (e.g., sentence length) and adaptive ones that are models that are trained interactively to predict the annotation time (we use this as a proxy for difficulty). Finally, in this work we only investigate easy-instances-first strategies, so the annotated instances are sorted in ascending difficulty.\n Facts: \n1. evaluate heuristic and interactively trained estimators on three English datasets that provide annotation time which we use as an approximation of the annotation difficulty for evaluation.\n2. We instantiate AC with an \"easy-instancesfirst\" strategy \n\n\nHow do the non-adaptive measures perform compared to the adaptive ones?\n\nOverall, we find that the heuristic ones perform quite well. In fact, our best performing estimator was using the BERT mlm loss (this is not in the displayed text, but an analysis is provided in the results section). \n Facts: \n1. The results show that using a simple heuristic to order instances can already significantly reduce the total annotation time while preserving a high annotation quality.\n\n\n"

At each step, DOCHOPPER retrieves a paragraph or sentence embedding from the document, mixes the retrieved result with the query, and updates the query for the next step.\n2. This means that model is end-to-end differentiable.\n\n\ncan you describe how does the query be updated?\n\nThe query is updated, intuitively speaking, by computing the residual query information that is not covered by the answer of the previous hop. This happens in the embedding space using simple vector operations. Would you like to know more about how the system deals with long documents?\n Facts: \n1.  At each retrieval step, DOCHOPPER retrieves a candidate (paragraph or sentence) from the index and updates the query for the next step of retrieval.\n\n\nYes, please tell me more how to deal long documents\n\nThe transformer-based model ETC is used that is based on sparse attention. This does not only allow longer input token length, but also enables modeling paragraphs (and hereby document structure) very naturally. \n Facts: \n1. Transformer models that use sparse self-attention have been introduced\n2. ETC  introduced a global-local attention mechanism, where local tokens only attend to the global tokens they are assigned to, while global tokens attend to each other to communicate information across a document.\n\n\nhow does the model decide when to retrieve a sentence or a paragraph?\n\nGood question! Both are represented in the vector space and the one most fitting one for the question is selected.\n Facts: \n1. At each retrieval step, DOCHOPPER retrieves a candidate (paragraph or sentence) from the index and updates the query for the next step of retrieval.\n\n\n"

Do you want to know what objectives the model trained on?\n Facts: \n1. Since in English word order is important, we preserve it by adding these connections into the graph layer.\n\n\nYes, please. Which objectives did the model try to solve?\n\nThe model is trained for part-of-speech tagging and syntactic dependency parsing.\n Facts: \n1. The SIWR model jointly predicts part-of-speech (POS) tags and syntactic dependencies.\n\n\nAnd which pre-trained word representations did you use?\n\nOur model can take both static and contextualized word representations including GloVe, ELMo and BERT.\n Facts: \n1. a graph-based neural model is built on top of either static or contextualised word representations such as GloVe, ELMo and BERT.\n2. We first prepare pre-trained static and contextual word representations, e.g., GloVe, ELMo, and contextual BERT, as the base representations.\n\n\nHow did you evaluate the improvement of the new word representations?\n\nWe compare performance of using the word representations in the downstream tasks compared to using the base representations.

Can you explain what is the main idea of the paper?\n\nThis paper proposes a method to incorporate syntactic information into pre-trained word representations using a graph neural network.\n Facts: \n1. we propose new syntactically-informed word representations (SIWRs), which allow us to enrich the pre-trained word representations with syntactic information without training language models from scratch.\n2.

Is it based on dependency or constituency? \n\nWe use part-of-speech and syntactic dependency. \n Facts: \n1. The syntactic information, i.e., part-of-speech (POS) tags and dependencies (see example in Fig. 1 ; in this paper, we use the term ''syntactic information\" interchangeably with ''POS tags\" and ''dependencies\"), has been well studied and can be obtained efficiently with high accuracy using existing \n\n\nSounds great!

In addition, we implement BERT [19] in both contextual and fine-tuning methods on nested NER and binary RE.\n\n\nCan you tell me why you only select part-of-speech and dependency as the syntactic information you want to use to help pretraining?\n\nPrevious work shows that part-of-speech and dependency are useful for downstream tasks. However, this doesn't limit the use of other information such as coreference in our model.\n Facts: \n1. Recent studies have shown that downstream task performance may benefit from linguistic structures such as syntactic information [11, 12] , even when contextual word representations and pre-trained models are also used [13] [14] [15] .\n\n\nThanks for explaining. I love to see the results of injecting other types of information. Do you think if it would be a good idea if you try to inject syntactic information beginning from pretraining from scratch?\n\nWe cannot answer given the current content. We can inject syntactic information during pre-training from scratch, however, this will cost more time and computational resources. Intermediate pretraining allows us to directly incorporate additional information into pre-trained models.\n Facts:\n1.

In this paper, we provide an overview of common methods to incorporate position information into Transformer models.\n2. Transformers are arguably the main workhorse in recent Natural Language Processing research.\n\n\nWhat do you mean with position information? Like indices of tokens?\n\nYes, I mean word order. A sentence only makes sense in the right order. A bag of words is ambiguous.\n Facts: \n1. text data is inherently sequential\n2. Without position information the meaning of a sentence is not well-defined (e.g., the sequence \"the cat chases the dog\" vs. the multi-set { the, the, dog, chases, cat }).\n\n\nSo what approaches of encoding position information does this work investigate?\n\nThere is a large variety of position models that is investigated. One contribution of the paper is to show this variety. Shall I give you some examples?\n Facts: \n1. The objectives of this survey are to i) showcase that position information in Transformer is a vibrant and extensive research area;\n2. Overall there is a huge variety of methods that add both absolute and relative position information to Transformer model.\n\n\nYes, some examples would be great!\n\nPosition embeddings representing absolute token index or the relative distance between tokens is an example. Another is injecting this information into the self-attention matrix. One work also uses an RNN to \"positionalize\" the input.\n Facts: \n1. Adding position information can be done by using position embeddings, manipulating attention matrices, or preprocessing the input with a recurrent neural network.\n\n\nSo between those two, what works better and for which tasks?\n\nUnfortunately, I do not have access to that information. But there is a discussion of matching position models to tasks later in the paper.\n Facts: \n1. indicating what characteristics of an application should be taken into account when selecting a position encoding\n\n\nThen let me ask a different question; is there a possibility of including positional information can hurt the model's performance? Has this been observed?\n\nThis is an interesting question. For natural language, this does not seem to be the case. What do you think about that?\n Facts: \n1. it should be beneficial to incorporate this essential inductive bias into any model that processes text data.\n\n\nGood question, I'd expect that in situations where positional information does not matter, models may get biased with additional noise.\n\nI agree. A task like this should have a lightweight position model if any.\n\nMaybe an attention based approach that is explicitly trained in both kind of tasks could handle them separately. What do you think?\n\nIn my opinion, the invariance to order can also be a strength for certain tasks. But I think it would be harder for an attention-based approach to ignore the position model if it is once trained without and once trained with it. Was this your suggestion?\n Facts: \n1. a Transformer is invariant with respect to reorderings of the input\n\n\n"

      "plainText": "Hi, the title sounds interesting, can you tell me more about the paper?\n\nHi, I agree that the title sounds interesting. The main topic of the paper is the Transformer model. Do you need information on this model?\n Facts: \n1. The Transformer model as introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017)\n2. Transformers are arguably the main workhorse in recent Natural Language Processing research.\n\n\nNo thanks, I am familiar with transformers. Is it a pure literature review of different ways to encode position in transformers, or do the authors also conduct experiments?\n\nIt is a survey paper. The main contribution is a theoretical overview of existing position models and no empirical analysis.\n Facts: \n1. The objectives of this survey are to i) showcase that position information in Transformer is a vibrant and extensive research area; ii) enable the reader to compare existing methods by providing a unified notation and meaningful clustering;\n\n\nAh I see, so they state if there are better and worse ones?\n\nI do not think that the main goal is to define better or worse. It is more about identifying similarities and differences (supported by the unified notation). They do have a discussion on matching a given task to a certain kind of application though.\n Facts: \n1. broad overview of relevant work on position information in Transformers that systematically aggregates and categorizes existing approaches and analyzes the differences between them\n2. indicating what characteristics of an application should be taken into account when selecting a position encoding\n\n\nDo they state if there are particular things to look out for when working with long documents?\n\nI do not have access to any concrete findings. But the position models of long document Transformers are certainly part of the survey. The authors state that they aim to complete the paper with newly published papers.\n Facts: \n1. We plan to actively continue adding papers that we missed or that are newly published.\n\n\nAh that is interesting. Is there a specific purpose for the paper?\n\nThey main purpose is to highlight the similarities and differences in existing position models. In that way, new possibilities for position encodings might be more evident. I think this work can be useful for the creators of new models.\n Facts: \n1. enabling the reader to compare existing methods by providing a unified notation and meaningful clustering\n2. providing stimuli for future research\n\n\nIs there a predominant method for position encodings that most people use?\n\nNo, not really. There is a lot going on and even \"old\" position models sometimes come back in a slight variant because they have a specific property that is useful for a new model or task.\n Facts: \n1. Overall there is a huge variety of methods that add both absolute and relative position information to Transformer model.\n\n\n"

      "plainText": "Hi, what are information-seeking questions?\n\nHi! Information seeking questions are goal-priented questions that seek for specific information in a specific paper unlike e.g. open domain questions.\n Facts: \n1. Readers of academic research papers often read with the goal of answering specific questions\n2. xisting informationseeking question answering datasets usually contain questions about generic factoid-type information.\n\n\nCan you give an example for that?\n\nSure! An example would be your initial question \"What are information-seeking questions?\". For this data a set of NLP experts was asked to come up with  questions on a paper based on title and abstract. Would you like to know more about the annotation process?\n Facts: \n1.  Each question is written by an NLP practitioner who read only the title and abstract of the corresponding paper, and the question seeks information present in the full text.\n\n\nYes, please tell me more about how the data was collected and annotated.\n\nFor a limited set of papers the first set of NLP experts would come up with the mentioned information-seeking questions. Another set of experts was then presented the questions and had to write an answer and provide evidence from the paper (if possible).\n Facts: \n1. a dataset of 5,049 questions over 1,585 Natural Language Processing papers. Each question is written by an NLP practitioner \n2. questions are then answered by a separate set of NLP practitioners who also provide supporting evidence\n\n\nWas there any quality assurance process included between both steps?\n\nI cannot answer this from abstract and introduction. But you might be interested in model performance on the data, right?\n\nHm, too bad. If we don't know how good the data is, doesn't this make it difficult to assess the performance of any model?\n\nYes, this is very true. In fact, the model performance is rather low, suggesting possibly a very high complexity of the task - or possibly an ill-defined task setup.\n Facts: \n1. We find that existing models that do well on other QA tasks do not perform well on answering these questions, underperforming humans by at least 27 F 1 points when answering them from entire papers\n\n\nHm, interesting. What models were investigated and on which QA tasks were they evaluated?\n\nLED and IR-baselines were used. The dataset combines multiple question types that require yes/no answers or full sentences from the paper.\n\n"

The paper introduces a new dataset of questions on research papers that typically require multiple parts of the paper to be answered.\n Facts: \n1. data that reflect the difficulty of the task arising from complex reasoning about claims made in multiple parts of a paper.\n2. In contrast, existing informationseeking question answering datasets usually contain questions about generic factoid-type information.\n\n\nCould you please tell me more about the datasets? What is the corpus size? And what kind of scientific domains are involved?\n\nSure! The papers come from the NLP domain. It contains roughly 5k questions and 1.5k papers.

What do you think? Do you think it is enough?\n\nI would agree that it is rather small, but inevitable because highly educated experts are required. In fact, the low performance of proposed models and baselines could be connected to insufficient training size.\n Facts: \n1. We find that existing models that do well on other QA tasks do not perform well on answering these questions, underperforming humans by at least 27 F 1 points when answering them from entire papers\n\n\nOK. Are there new approaches proposed in this paper?\n\nYes, there are! LED is used and compared against standard IR baselines.\n\nWhat is LED then?

In this paper, we provide an overview of common methods to incorporate position information into Transformer models.\n\n\nCan you give me more information about what a position model is?\n\nThe Transformer itself cannot see the order of its input tokens. A position model is what helps the Transformer to see the order. This can be embeddings or other manipulations of the self-attention.\n Facts: \n1. Adding position information can be done by using position embeddings, manipulating attention matrices, or preprocessing the input with a recurrent neural network.\n2. A Transformer model itself is invariant with respect to re-orderings of the input.\n\n\nSo embeddings and self-attention manipulations are the main position modes, is it correct?\n\nYes, this is correct. There are a lot of variants but these are the two main categories.\n Facts: \n1. Overall there is a huge variety of methods that add both absolute and relative position information to Transformer model.\n\n\nDoes the authors provide a common benchmark to compare the methods?\n\nNo, there is no empirical evaluation mentioned. But they compare the methods on a theoretical level. They also characterize which position model should go with what type of application. Do you think this is useful without a new benchmark?\n Facts: \n1. enabling the reader to compare existing methods by providing a unified notation and meaningful clustering\n2. indicating what characteristics of an application should be taken into account when selecting a position encoding\n\n\nI think the theoretical comparison is much more important than the experimental one.

I do not think that it can really answer the question which position model is \"best\". What criterion for \"being best\" do you have in mind?\n\nI was wondering if one of the two is more spread than the other.\n\nI do not have information about the frequency that the different types of position models occur.

In fact, the proposed models perform a lot worse than humans.\n Facts: \n1. We find that existing models that do well on other QA tasks do not perform well on answering these questions, underperforming humans by at least 27 F 1 points when answering them from entire papers\n\n\nWhat is the model proposed?\n\nThe proposed model is based on LED (a global-local transformer).

      "plainText": "Hi! What is the main idea of the paper?\n\nThe main idea of this paper is to train annotators by sorting annotations by e.g. their difficulty so that they are gradually  introduced to the annotation project. Do you think that is a reasonable idea?\n Facts: \n1. The goal is to gradually introduce annotators into the task by ordering instances that are annotated according to a learning curriculum.\n\n\nYes, that sounds very smart! Is the effect of potential biases introduced this way investigated?\n\nWe conducted a carefully constructed user study with 40 participants that showed improvements using our methods compared to not sorting and we saw no big impact in annotation quality while reducing annotation speed. Does this answer your question?\n Facts: \n1. Finally, we apply our strategy and its best estimators in a carefully designed user study with 40 participants for annotating English tweets about the Covid-19 pandemic. \n2. The results show that annotators who receive the same instances in an optimized order require significantly less annotation time while retaining a high annotation quality. \n\n\nYes, it does! I see that the underlying data domain are tweets on Covid-19 -- can you tell me more about the dataset used??\n\nThis dataset is about misconceptions about Covid-19, e.g. that Ginger Ale can cure it. Annotators were presented a tweet that mentioned such a misconception and were asked to select the most fitting category from a list of 4. Do you think that is a good task to evaluate on? \n Facts: \n1. Finally, a user study is conducted with 40 voluntary participants who are asked to identify the most fitting misconception for English tweets about the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\nI see! I think it seems like a moderately difficult task, although I could imagine there are some ambiguities. I would say it is fitting. Can you tell me how the different sorting strategies looked like?\n\nWe sort by difficulty where difficulty comes either from heuristics like readability or masked language model score or learn to regress annotation times. Do you think annotation time is a good proxy for difficulty?\n Facts: \n1. We instantiate AC with an \"easy-instancesfirst\" strategy and evaluate heuristic and interactively trained estimators on three English datasets that provide annotation time which we use as an approximation of the annotation difficulty for evaluation.\n\n\nYes, while it might not cover the whole complexity of difficulty this is the quantity we are most interested in the end. Time and hereby money for annotation. I am wondering, did the annotation quality of the \"non-trained\" annotators increase towards the end of the study too?\n\nThe annotation quality stayed mostly the same on a high level for all groups, we just measured improvement in annotation time. Do you have any more question?\n Facts: \n1. The results show that annotators who receive the same instances in an optimized order require significantly less annotation time while retaining a high annotation quality.\n\n\n"

Do you think that is a good idea?\n Facts: \n1. The goal is to gradually introduce annotators into the task by ordering instances that are annotated according to a learning curriculum.\n\n\nSounds good but I'm not sure. What kind of task does it use for?\n\nWe use it to speed up annotation or sentence and paragraph level annotation tasks, e.g. POS, NER or sentence classification. We also conduct a user study for that. Do you want to hear more about the user study?\n Facts: \n1. this work formalizes annotation curricula for sentence-and paragraph-level annotation tasks\n\n\nSure tell me more about that.\n\nWe conduct a user study to test wheter annotation curricula work. The data is about selecting the most fitting misconception about Covid-19 from a list. We show that using our method significantly reduces annotation time while not hurting annotation quality. \n Facts: \n1. Finally, a user study is conducted with 40 voluntary participants who are asked to identify the most fitting misconception for English tweets about the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\n\nThat's excellent. So how do you measure annotation quality?\n\nWe have the gold labels, so we compute accuracy. Does this sound reasonable?\n Facts: \n1. The results show that annotators who receive the same instances in an optimized order require significantly less annotation time while retaining a high annotation quality. \n\n\nYes. And you also said you reduced annotation time, what's the baseline you compare to?\n\nOur user study has 40 participants some get annotation curriula and others get random orders. We also have a warmup phase with a fixed order that is the same for all groups. Do you have any questions left?\n Facts: \n1. Finally, a user study is conducted with 40 voluntary participants who are asked to identify the most fitting misconception for English tweets about the Covid-19 pandemic.\n2. The results show that using a simple heuristic to order instances can already significantly reduce the total annotation time while preserving a high annotation quality. \n\n\nOne last question, how many time did you reduce?\n\nWe were able to reduce the time by around 20% when using gold order.\n Facts: \n1.  The results show that annotators who receive the same instances in an optimized order require significantly less annotation time while retaining a high annotation quality. \n\n\n"

      "plainText": "What do you mean with low resource domain?\n\nWe say low resource domains are domains were data is scare, e.g. because of the language or because of the content. In our case, that is old English texts. Is that what you also understand as low resource?\n Facts: \n1. Throughout this work, we focus on texts from digital humanities, to be more precise, texts written in Early Modern English texts, including poems, biographies, novels as well as legal documents. \n\n\nInteresting, I agree. So how does this approach work?\n\nWe need to annotate data as it does not exist yet. As annotating is annoying, we support users with machine learning algorithms during that. Do you want to hear more about the support our system can provide?\n Facts: \n1. For this initial data creation step, we developed a novel Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) annotation approach.\n2. We present a generic, KB-agnostic annotation approach for low-resource settings and provide a ready-to-use implementation so that researchers can easily annotate data for their use cases.\n\n\nCan you provide a more specific answer, like what algorithms are used and how the support comes in? \n\nWe help users to find spans that contain named entities and we help them to select the right one from the knowledge base search by reranking. Models are trained interactively in the loop. Does this clarify things?\n Facts: \n1. We therefore present a novel domain-agnostic Human-In-The-Loop annotation approach: \n2. we use recommenders that suggest potential concepts and adaptive candidate ranking, thereby speeding up the overall annotation process and making it less tedious for users.\n\n\nOnly partly. Are the spans identified by the model as well or by the user? \n\nThe annotator is still in charge and needs to acutally select spans, the machine learning models are just there to give suggestions.\n Facts: \n1. we use recommenders that suggest potential concepts and adaptive candidate ranking\n2. we therefore add interactive machine learning annotation support that helps the user find entities in the text\n\n\nso the input is the selected span and the model provides a ranking for the labels?\n\nFor the reranking part, the user selects a span and then searches for the right entity. These are both used as inputs for the reranking.\n Facts: \n1. e use recommenders that suggest potential concepts and adaptive candidate ranking\n2. we therefore add interactive machine learning annotation support that helps the user find entities in the text and select the correct knowledge base entries for them\n\n\nSounds promising! So how well do the models perform?\n\nUsing these in a user study, we measured an annotation time improvement of up to 35%. Do you think this is useful?\n Facts: \n1. We show that statistical machine learning models can be used in an interactive entity linking setting to improve annotation speed by over 35%.\n\n\nIt depends, improvement of 35% compared to what baseline?\n\nTo not using annotation support. Do you have any more questions?\n\nCould you quantify if there was any bias introduced due to the recommendations?\n\nThat we did not measure.\n Facts: \n1. In a user study, the annotation speed improves by 35 % compared to annotating without interactive support; users report that they strongly prefer our system.\n\n\nBut couldn't it be that users were wrongly biased towards what the model suggested?\n\nThe model suggest spans, but it does only rerank the candidates, so while it could bias I do not think that it did much\n Facts: \n1. To improve annotation speed and quality, we therefore add interactive machine learning annotation support that helps the user find entities in the text and select the correct knowledge base entries for them. \n\n\n"
